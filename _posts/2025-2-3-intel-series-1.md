**Intel Series**: Part 1

In this post, I will be going over the history of several historical Intel CPUs that introduced several technologies that has benefited modern day compute, and the world. I referred to the [Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-sdm.html), Volume 1: Basic Architecture for the list of CPUs (I digest this manual in my free time).

This article is the first of a series of posts where I cover Intel (products, technologies, etc.) in detail, as an enthusiast. This is a hobby of mine, and I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoy writing it.

As of the writing of this post, Intel is not as great as it once was. While it is true that Intel is still considered dominant, especially in the consumer market (the enthusiasts excluded, they jumped to AMD), but it does not mean that we get to neglect its contributions and the impact that it has had on the world. Intel, is considered as the company that placed "Silicon" in "Silicon Valley"!

It is recommended that you have an basic/intermediate understanding of the x86 architecture and computer science in general. Worry not, there are links attached for further reading and explanations.

**WARNING**: This post is a long one!

## Intel 8086

The 8086 was the first x86 CPU that Intel released, back in 1978. It has 16-bit registers and 16-bit external data bus, with 20-bit addressing giving an impressive 1 MB address space.

This CPU introduced [segmentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_segmentation). With segmentation, a 16-bit segment register contains a pointer to a memory segment of up to 64 KB. Using four segment registers at once, the 8086 processors can address up to 256 KB without switching between segments. The 20-bit addresses can be formed using a segment register and an additional 16-bit pointer provides a total address range of up to 1MB.

## Intel 286 (80286)

In 1982, Intel released the Intel 286 processor. It introduced [protected mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_mode) operation into the IA-32 architecture. This mode uses the segment register content as selectors or pointers into descriptor tables. Descriptors provide 24-bit base addressses with a physical memory size of up to 16 MB, support for virtual memory management (on a segment swapping basis), and a number of protection mechanisms which includes:

- — Segment limit checking.
- — Read-only and execute-only segment options.
- — Four privilege levels.

## Intel386 (80386)

Released in 1985, the 386 was the first 32-bit processor in the IA-32 architecture and introduced 32-bit registers for use to hold both operands and addressing. The lower half of each 32-bit register retains the properties of earlier generation's 16-bit registers - hence allowed backward compatibility. It also provides a virtual 8086 mode for executing programs that were written for the 8086.

Additionally, the 386 also has support for:

- — A 32-bit address bus, allowing for a 4 GB address space.
- — Segmented-memory and flat memory models.
- – Paging, with a fixed 4 KB page size which provides a method of virtual memory management.
- – Parellel stages.

## Intel486

Unveiled in 1989, the 486 added more parellel execution capabilities by expanding the 386's instruction pipeline to 5 stages, with each stage operating in parellel with the others on up to 5 instructions in different stages of execution.

The processor also added the following:

- – An 8 KB on-chip first-level (L1) cache.
- – An integrated x87 [FPU (floating-point unit)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_unit).
- – Power saving and system management features.

## Intel Pentium Family

The introduction of Pentium in 1993 added a second execution pipeline which allows the processor to achieve superscalar performance. The two pipelines together can execute two instructions per clock in parellel. The on-chip L1 cache doubled - with 8 KB devoted to code and another 8 KB devoted to data.

Another significant addition was the introduction of [branch prediction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_predictor), which improved performance in looping constructs.

In addition, Pentium also added features highlighted below:

- – Extensions to make the virtual 8086 mode more efficient.
- – Internal data paths of 128 and 256 bits.
- – Burstable external data bus was increased to 64 bits.
- – An [APIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Programmable_Interrupt_Controller) which allows for multiple processors to be connected to a single system bus.
- – Dual processor mode.

This processor was also the first to support the [MMX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMX_(instruction_set)) technology.

## Intel P6 Family (Pentium Pro, Pentium II, Pentium III)

The P6 family of processors was based on a superscalar microarchitecture, which set new performance standards, released from 1995 to 1999. It consists of various processors, such as the Pentium Pro, Pentium II, Pentium II and III (and its Xeon variants), and Celeron. However, this section will focus primarily on the Pentium Pro, Pentium II, and Pentium III processors.

### Pentium Pro

A three-way superscalar processor, which is capable of executing three instructions per clock cycle using parellel processing techniques. It also introduced dynamic execution (micro-data flow analysis, out-of-order execution, superior branch prediction, and speculative execution). It has the same cache as the Pentium, but with a 256 KB L2 cache.

### Pentium II

Introduces the previously mentioned MMX technology (from the Pentium) to the P6 microarchitecture, along with some other enhancements to packaging and hardware. The L1 caches were enlarged to 16 KB each, and the L2 cache supported 256 KB, 512 KB, and 1 MB sizes. To conserve power during idle periods, the Pentium II also introduced AutoHALT, Stop-Grant, Sleep, and Deep Sleep.

The Xeon variant featured a 2 MB L2 cache, and some enhancements to its backside bus.

### Pentium III

The Pentium III introduced the [SSE (Streaming SIMD Extensions)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_SIMD_Extensions) to the IA-32 architecture. SSE expands the SIMD execution model introduced with Intel MMX technology by providing 128-bit registers and the ability to perform SIMD operations on packed single precision floating-point values.

Its Xeon variant has minor enhancements made to extend the performance of the processor.

## Intel Pentium 4 Family

Released from the dawn of the new millenium to 2006, the Pentium 4 family is based on the [NetBurst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBurst) microarchitecture. This processor introduces [SSE2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE2), and its 3.40 GHz version is the first to support [Hyper-Threading Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-threading) and [SSE3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE3).

The [Intel 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64) architecture is introduced with the Pentium 4 Extreme Edition (which also supports Hyper-Threading Technology) and in Intel Pentium 4 6xx and 7xx series processors.

[Intel Virtualization Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization#Intel_virtualization_(VT-x)) is then introduced in the Pentium 4 672 and 662.

## Intel Xeon Family

## Why End Here?

Beyond the 2nd Gen Intel Core family of processors, changes made to the microarchitecture and overall design of the processors have been minimal - until the release of the 12th Gen Alder Lake processors (which introduced the P-Core and E-Core architecture, which deserves its own post), hence why I have decided to end this post here. Besides, its titled "historical" after all.

## Outro

Thanks for reading this post - apologies for the exceptionally long post, and for not posting after 2+ months, but worry not, I have a lot of content in the pipeline.

In **part 2** of the Intel series, I will be covering an brief overview of the Intel Core generations, and the jump from the 11th Gen Intel Core processors to the 12th Gen Intel Core processors, and the introduction of the P-Core and E-Core architecture, alongside its benefits and issues.
